# Reviewing-Indicators-of-Compromise-IoCs-and-threat-intelligence-sources
Overview
This document provides a summary of my work and learning progress in understanding Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), threat intelligence sources, exploit research databases, security policy templates, and security benchmarks. These resources and activities enhance my knowledge in cybersecurity threat hunting, defensive tactics, and security configuration management, especially useful for aspiring cybersecurity analysts.

Activities and Key Learnings
1. Understanding IoCs and Threat Intelligence Sources
IoCs and Threat Feeds: Learned about Indicators of Compromise and how threat intelligence feeds provide actionable intelligence for defense against attacks. Explored the importance of these sources from both open-source and commercial entities, and their role in proactive and reactive cybersecurity measures.

Sources Explored:

Center for Internet Security (CIS) Real-Time Indicator Feeds for US State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial entities (SLTTs).
AlienVault Open Threat Exchange (OTX) for real-time threat indicators and research community contributions.
Hands-On Work:

Practiced navigating CIS and AlienVault OTX platforms to explore IoCs. Searched for indicators related to the Mirai botnet, examined types of IoCs (e.g., Registrar, Host system, FileHash, Victim ID), and viewed relevant analysis and related threat pulses.
Practiced using various IoC-related search terms like "URL," "IPv4," "IPv6," "hostname," and "hash."
2. Exploring the Exploit Database (Exploit-DB)
Purpose: Exploit-DB is a CVE-compliant archive maintained by Offensive Security, providing a collection of public exploits and vulnerable software for penetration testing and vulnerability research.

Features Explored:

Reviewed a comprehensive list of recent exploits with details like Date, Title, Vulnerable Application, Type (DOS, Local, Remote, WebApp), Platform, and Author.
Practiced using Exploit Database filters such as Type, Platform, Author, and Port for targeted searches.
Additional Resources:

Google Hacking Database (GHDB): Practiced using "Google dorks" for targeted vulnerability searches, specifically focusing on "Files Containing Passwords" to understand how attackers might locate sensitive information.
Security Papers and Shellcodes: Explored the resources for more in-depth research on specific security issues and attack payloads.
3. Reviewing and Customizing Security Policy Templates
Resource: SANS Institute provides a range of downloadable, customizable security policy templates covering categories like Network Security and Application Security.

Templates Studied:

Wireless Communication Policy: Reviewed network security best practices.
Web Application Security Policy: Analyzed web application security protocols to enhance cybersecurity posture within an organization.
4. Accessing Security Benchmarks and Configuration Guides
CIS Benchmarks: Examined CIS benchmarks for secure configuration guides across various categories such as Operating Systems, Cloud Providers, Network Devices, and Desktop Software.

Explored Topics:

Microsoft Windows Server Benchmarks: Reviewed guidelines for secure configurations to mitigate vulnerabilities.
Benchmark Categories: Covered additional product categories like Amazon Web Services, Docker, Apple MacOS, Firefox, and more.
Key Takeaways
IoC Feeds and Threat Intelligence: A critical component of cybersecurity threat detection and hunting is leveraging reputable IoC feeds and community intelligence sources.
Exploit Database: Access to public exploits, downloadable payloads, and vulnerability details is essential for understanding potential risks and improving penetration testing skills.
Security Policy Templates: Using established policy frameworks helps create customized, effective security policies tailored to specific organizational needs.
CIS Benchmarks: Following established secure configuration guides from CIS is a reliable approach to mitigating risks on various platforms and devices.
Conclusion
These resources and exercises strengthened my understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals like IoCs, threat intelligence, exploit databases, policy development, and secure configurations. They provide a foundation for proactive threat detection, incident response planning, and compliance with industry standards as I continue on my journey to becoming a cybersecurity analyst.
